# 👋 Hi, I'm Ubaid ur Rehman  
💻 Full-Stack Developer | 🚀 GenAI Explorer | 🌐 Future Solution Architect  

I’m passionate about building **scalable backend & frontend systems** and integrating **Generative AI** into real-world applications.  
Currently on a **long-term roadmap (2025-2026)** to transition into a **GenAI-enabled Solution Architect** role.

## 📚 What I’m Exploring Right Now
- **Docker & Kubernetes** → Docker Mastery: with Kubernetes +Swarm from a Docker Captain (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/)  
  Focus: Build, test, deploy containers with the best mega-course on Docker, Kubernetes, Compose, GitHub Actions CI using DevOps

- **Generative AI Foundations** → [Generative AI with LangChain & HuggingFace (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-langchain-huggingface/)  
  Focus: LLMs, vector DBs, embeddings, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🏅 Certifications
- **Node.js (Advanced Concepts & APIs)** → [View Certificate](https://udemy-certificate.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/UC-fea736e2-1b75-4633-9846-d578a9259a4c.pdf)  

- **NestJS Mastery** → [View Certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-ce9ce346-815f-4827-b4bd-10259c4b2ef6/)  


- *(More certificates coming soon — System Design, Cloud, AI specializations!)* 

Remember: Certifications alone don’t matter, but when paired with hands-on practice they prove real value — they let me take what I already know from frameworks, fill the gaps instructors cover with best practices we often skip, and keep me continuously upskilling.
